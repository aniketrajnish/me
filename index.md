## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me3.jpg">

I'm a sophomore and the secertary of game developement club at IIT Gandhinagar ([DigiS IIT Gandhinagr](https://www.instagram.com/digis_iitgn/)). I'm into developing games, VFX, video editing and simulations. I prefer commiting on Unity Collab than Git. The sole puprose of my Git account is this page, however I might share some of my code in the future if I feel it is worth sharing. I've mentioned some of my work below. If you want the source code/ build of any of these or wanna collab you can hit me up!

## Fun Side Projects

* [Realtime Jelly Simulation in Unity](https://youtu.be/fMwoglpPgFk)<br>
  This simulation was rendered in real-time using Unity. This Project aims at rendering complex simulations like this in real-time which can take hours to render on a decent PC.
  
* [Non Euclidean World in Unity](https://youtu.be/fMwoglpPgFk)<br>
  Demonstration of a real-time non-euclidean world I made using Unity. This project can be used in puzzle games based on optical illusion. Inspired by the works of CodeParade.
 
* [Realtime Slime Simulation in Unity](https://youtu.be/a__DdXiYQ-U)<br>
  2 hours of code, 2 weeks of Fluid Mechanics. Rendered in real-time using Unity.<br>
  Disclaimer: Couldn't make it look aesthetically appealing as adding a transparent material with a reflection probe attached to so many particles could have possibly fried my     PC.
  
* [Putting my simulations to work - 2048 Jelly](https://youtu.be/9tfnqnrit_0)<br> 
  This game uses real-time Jelly-Physics that I developed in Unity. Currently, I'm working on optimizing this code and the game for low-end devices (especially mobile devices).
  Right now, for the cubes to simulate a jelly effortlessly they need around 1.2 million tris each, which is quite resource consuming. Given that by using only 5 of them my PC     (GTX-1050, i5-8250U) could barely hit 60fps. When the game will be optimized enough to run on a high-end mobile device (SD845 or later) then I'll release it. 
  
* [Fun with shaders - GameJam 2020 AD Trailer](https://youtu.be/4zfHbw6GRes)<br> 
  I made this trailer using a custom shader that I wrote for Unity. This shader uses one-sided features of multiple planes to give a non-euclidean look (currently working on a     puzzle-game based project that uses this!).  Also, I wrote a shader to replicate the look of HDRP reflective materials using Unity's built-in render pipeline and a reflection   probe. Added the materials based on these shaders to the mascots and the jar!

## Project Holly

 * This project aims at unifying games and movies in ways never done before
 * A platform for completely interactive movies
 * The movies will proceed in the way you want them to
 * Your choices form one of the many perspectives
 * You take control of the protagonist
 * Everything is streamed online so you only use your data for what you want
 * Try the demo [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makra.Holly)
 * Developed an asset that allows one to stream a video in small chunks accroding to his choices.

## Computer Graphics

 * [Raymarching Engine](https://github.com/aniketrajnish/Raymarching-Engine)<br>
   Currently writing a raymarching engine in Unity. This technique allows rendering complex geometry like fractals, n-dimensional objects, volumetric clouds, etc. using very little computation costs by just comping up with a distance function for the surface that we want to render.
 * [Teserract Unity Implementation](https://github.com/aniketrajnish/4D-tesseract-unity-implementation)<br>
   A rotating hypercube implemented in unity using mesh generation and GL library. Underlying maths includes rotation & projection of coordinates using rotation & projection matrices.
 * [Rendering a 4D Hypercube](https://editor.p5js.org/aniketrajnish/sketches/wJVjV9OAY)<br>
   Demonstration of a 3D section of a rotating 4D Hypercube (with hardcoded coordinates) by using rotation and projection matrices as a part of project of the MA202 course at      IITGN. Currently working upon ray marching techinques to expand this technique to render complete 4D worlds in Unity.
 * [3D Render using Gaussian elimination](https://editor.p5js.org/aniketrajnish/sketches/S-KwEmoSm)<br>
   Mathematically modeled a 3D rendering technique that uses numerical methods to calculate the intersection of planes and render 3D objects as a part of a project of the MA202      course at IITGN. Currently planning to apply the underlying methodology to the 4th dimension and develop a 4D rendering engine that uses these numerical methods instead of      the traditional approach of using ray marching/ projection and rotation matrices.
 * [Specular lighting in OpenGL](https://github.com/aniketrajnish/specular-lighting-opengl)<br>
   Implemented specular ligting in OpenGL by following tutorials from [Michael Grieco](https://michaelg29.github.io/)
 * [Raycast 3D renderer](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/510603211/)<br>
   A 3D renderer I implemented in scratch that uses the traditional concept of raycasting used in games like VCOP2 and Wolfenstein 3D.
 * [Non Euclidean World in Unity](https://youtu.be/wi1RoQJWHbk)<br>
   Optical illusion made by using multiple intersecting single-sided planes instead of a 3d mesh.

## Simulations
 
 * [Realtime Jelly Simulation in Unity](https://youtu.be/fMwoglpPgFk)<br>
   Wrote an optimized jelly physics algorithm that works in realtime on different platforms using spring joints between armatures! 
 
 * [Realtime Slime Simulation in Unity](https://youtu.be/a__DdXiYQ-U)<br>
   Similar approach as jelly simulation used but with more spring density to make the mesh look more viscous.
 * [Fire Simulation in Blender](https://youtu.be/_QH19dipOxY)<br> 
   Done with the help of one of my club members.
   
 * [Putting my simulations to work - 2048 Jelly](https://youtu.be/9tfnqnrit_0)<br> 
   This game uses real-time Jelly-Physics that I mentioned above.  

## Higher Dimension 
 
 * [Raymarching Engine](https://youtu.be/a__DdXiYQ-U)<br>
   Currently writing a raymarching engine in Unity primariy to come up with a set of tools that would allow people to visualize and create higher dimensional worlds like they do in a 3D modelling software like Maya, 3ds, blender etc.
 * [Rendering a 4D Hypercube](https://github.com/aniketrajnish/4d-rendering-ma202-project)<br> 
   My first project on higher dimension visualisation was demonstration of a 3D section of a rotating 4D Hypercube by using rotation and projection matrices
   
 * [Teserract Unity Implementationy](https://github.com/aniketrajnish/4D-tesseract-unity-implementation)<br> 
   A rotating hypercube implemented in unity using mesh generation and GL library.
   
 * [4D Hypercube NFT Marketplace](https://opensea.io/collection/4d-hypercubes)<br>
   Created a NFT collection of 4D hypercubes rotating along different axes.  

## VFX & Edits
  
 * [Messing around with shaders - GameJam 2020 AD Trailer](https://youtu.be/4zfHbw6GRes)<br> 
   I made this trailer using a shader that I wrote for Unity. This shader uses one-sided features of multiple planes to give a non-euclidean look (currently working on a    puzzle-game based project that uses this!).  Also, I wrote a shader to replicate the look of HDRP reflective materials using Unity's built-in render pipeline and a reflection    probe. Added the materials based on these shaders to the mascots and the jar!
  
 * [Messing around with VFX Graphs - GameJam 2020 AD Theme Reveal Video](https://youtu.be/kPlAOdrKgbw)<br> 
   I had to make a theme reveal for a game jam that my college is hosting. So I decided to utilize this opportunity and learn VFX graphs in Unity. VFX graphs help to simulate over a million particles in real-time using the parallel processing power of GPU unlike the paticle system which works over the CPU and is much slower. Everything that you see in this video is made out of '2020', which was the theme for the JAM itself.
  
 * [Messing around with Particle Systems - Psychedelic Edit](https://youtu.be/ofWcNlWYwnI)<br> 
   Because Dani said 'You can make anything using Unity's particle system'
  
 * [Recreated Coldplay's Up&Up Music Video](https://youtu.be/gy9gc2orpCY)<br> 
   Rendered using Motion Tracking in Blender and After Effects
   
 * [Recreated Interstellar's Black Hole](https://youtu.be/pGvQrE8Plsc)<br> 
   With 0 budget, blender and the help of my senior.<br><br>
   *Fun Fact: Most of the trailers and intro videos for societies, events & fests of IITGn are made on game Engines instead of dedicated editing softwares as it is done by us.*

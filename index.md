## Simulations
 
 * [Realtime Jelly Simulation in Unity](https://youtu.be/fMwoglpPgFk)<br>
   This simulation was rendered in real-time using Unity. This Project aims at rendering complex simulations like this in real-time which can take hours to render on a decent      PC.
  
 * [Non Euclidean World in Unity](https://youtu.be/wi1RoQJWHbk)<br>
   Demonstration of a real-time non-euclidean world I made using Unity. This project can be used in puzzle games based on optical illusion. Inspired by the works of CodeParade.
 
 * [Realtime Slime Simulation in Unity](https://youtu.be/a__DdXiYQ-U)<br>
   2 hours of code, 2 weeks of Fluid Mechanics. Rendered in real-time using Unity.<br>
   Disclaimer: Couldn't make it look aesthetically appealing as adding a transparent material with a reflection probe attached to so many particles could have possibly fried my    PC.
 * [Fire Simulation in Blender](https://youtu.be/_QH19dipOxY)<br> 
   Done with the help of one of my club members.
   
 * [Putting my simulations to work - 2048 Jelly](https://youtu.be/9tfnqnrit_0)<br> 
   This game uses real-time Jelly-Physics that I developed in Unity. Currently, I'm working on optimizing this code and the game for low-end devices (especially mobile devices).
   Right now, for the cubes to simulate a jelly effortlessly they need around 1.2 million tris each, which is quite resource consuming. Given that by using only 5 of them my PC    (GTX-1050, i5-8250U) could barely hit 60fps. When the game will be optimized enough to run on a high-end mobile device (SD845 or later) then I'll release it. 
  
## Project Holly
 * This project aims at unifying games and movies in ways never done before
 * A platform for completely interactive movies
 * The movies will proceed in the way you want them to
 * Your choices form one of the many perspectives
 * You take control of the protagonist
 * Everything is streamed online so you only use your data for what you want
 * Try the demo [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makra.Holly)
 
## POR
 1. Secretary, [DigiS IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.instagram.com/digis_iitgn/)
  * Leading a team of 70 game developers in my college. 
  * In the past 6 months, DigiS has become the most active club and the biggest Game Development College club amongst all IITs.
  * We've been the leading Indian game development team in several game jams.
  * Organized an AR workshop attended by 300 people from IIT Bombay, IIT Hyderabad & IIT Gandhinagar.
  * Organized [Game Jam 2020 AD](https://itch.io/jam/gamejam-2020-ad) in collaboration with [Amalthea IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.instagram.com/amalthea_iitgn/). 609 people         participated to make 96 games making it the third biggest Indian game jam to be held on itch.

 
 2. Eureka Video Coordinator
  * Led a team of 12 video editors.
  * Made the [Foundation Programme Video](https://youtu.be/SLwEwTwHNhM) of Btech'19, IITGn.


## VFX & Edits
  
 * [Messing around with shaders - GameJam 2020 AD Trailer](https://youtu.be/4zfHbw6GRes)<br> 
   I made this trailer using a custom shader that I wrote for Unity. This shader uses one-sided features of multiple planes to give a non-euclidean look (currently working on a    puzzle-game based project that uses this!).  Also, I wrote a shader to replicate the look of HDRP reflective materials using Unity's built-in render pipeline and a reflection    probe. Added the materials based on these shaders to the mascots and the jar!
  
 * [Messing around with VFX Graphs - GameJam 2020 AD Theme Reveal Video](https://youtu.be/kPlAOdrKgbw)<br> 
   I had to make a theme reveal for a game jam that my college is hosting. So I decided to utilize this opportunity and learn VFX graphs in Unity. VFX graphs help to simulate o    over a million particles in real-time. So everything that you see in this video is made out of '2020', which was the theme for the JAM itself.
  
 * [Messing around with Particle Systems - Psychedelic Edit](https://youtu.be/ofWcNlWYwnI)<br> 
   Because Dani said 'You can make anything using Unity's particle system'
  
 * [Recreated Coldplay's Up&Up Music Video](https://youtu.be/gy9gc2orpCY)<br> 
   Rendered using Motion Tracking in Blender and After Effects
   
 * [Recreated Interstellar's Black Hole](https://youtu.be/pGvQrE8Plsc)<br> 
   With 0 budget, blender and the help of my senior.<br><br>
   *Fun Fact: Most of the trailers and intro videos for societies, events & fests of IITGn are made on game Engines instead of dedicated editing softwares as it is done by us.*
  

## Misc

 * A [random shitpost game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makra.KillTheStickMan&hl=en&gl=US) that I made in 15 minutes blew up on play store and is being downloaded by thousands of users everyday.
 * My first unity project was a [FAP Simulator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14pdEJFl5diFXQK_w2OoOAnTkQGs10Eab/vi) XD

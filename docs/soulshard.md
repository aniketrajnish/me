## Soul Shard
Soul Shard is a a cooperative puzzle platformer that takes inspiration from EA's 'It Takes Two'. It is being developed by [19 Souls on Board](https://www.19soulsonboard.com/about), a team of 19 student developers from Cohort 18 at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy on the down town campus of the University of Central Florida. I'm assisting the team as a technical artist this summer.

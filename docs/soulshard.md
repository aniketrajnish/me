## Soul Shard
Soul Shard is a cooperative puzzle platformer that takes inspiration from EA's 'It Takes Two'. It is being developed by [19 Souls on Board](https://www.19soulsonboard.com/about), a team of 19 student developers from Cohort 18 at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy on the downtown campus of the University of Central Florida. I'm assisting the team as a technical artist this summer.

### Smoke Particles
My first task was to design and develop a stylized explosive smoke particles for various machinery and explosions in the game. The basic idea was to develop a working prototype and then refine it in the iterative design process.
